It's built to be fast (and also parses basic PHP as a little extra). It's written in Ruby and it uses `YAML` as config file format.\r\n### How to use?\r\nIt's simple, just make your config in `config.yml` (the keys are self explainable) and fire up Terminal and run `./boot.rb start` on the cloned directory. You can use `./boot.rb start -t` instead if you want to log everything (basically it doesn't daemonizes).\r\n### What gems are needed?\r\nNot much, just one (for now):\r\n\r\n* daemons: `gem install daemons`","google":"","name":"Typhoon","tagline":"A mini webserver written in Ruby"}
